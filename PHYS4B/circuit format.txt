V<name> <+> <-> <value> → independent voltage source
I<name> <+> <-> <value> → independent current source
R<name> <+> <-> <value> → resistor
C<name> <+> <-> <value> → capacitor
L<name> <+> <-> <value> → inductor

X<name> is how we define the component type and its name

<+> and <-> are the positive and negative terminals/nodes that the component is connected with. Those are strings

<value> are the numerical values of the components in their corresponding units. Those are floating point numbers.
